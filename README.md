# restfulAPI
This is a REpresentational State Transfer (RESTful) Application Programming Interface (API) written in Go. Using the HyperText Transfer Protocols (HTTP) methods you can access resources on the server in this case JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). These HTTP methods work similarly to CRUD with databases. POST works like Create. GET works like Read. PUT works like Update. DELETE works like Delete.
